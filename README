This app is meant to do one thing pretty decently: turn minecraft
backups/snapshots into nicely rendered PNGs.

So that I don't have to put my password on github, and type lots of options all
the time, I made a config file.

You'll want to copy example.ini to config.ini, and then tweak it as apporpriate!

If you don't the app will yell at you, so that's nice.
